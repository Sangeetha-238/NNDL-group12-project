# Art Generation from Text Descriptions

## Project Overview

This project aims to generate visual art from textual descriptions using a combination of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It leverages the WikiArt dataset for art styles and the Flickr30k dataset for text-based image descriptions.

## Datasets

- WikiArt Dataset: A comprehensive collection of artworks categorized by styles, artists, and genres.

- Flickr30k Dataset: Contains 30,000 images with five captions each, providing a diverse set of image descriptions.
