# Human Activity Recognition using Deep Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a Deep Learning model for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using LSTM and Multichannel CNN. The project aims to accurately classify human activities based on sensor data, leveraging the sequential nature of LSTM and the feature extraction capabilities of CNN.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. It consists of sensor data collected from a group of 30 volunteers performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
